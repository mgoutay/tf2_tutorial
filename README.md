# Tensorflow 2.0 tutorial
Here are some [slides](https://github.com/mgoutay/tf2_tutorial/blob/master/Training_school_TF2.0_V3.pdf) and a [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mgoutay/tf2_tutorial/blob/master/MNIST_tutorial.ipynb) that covers the basics about Tensorflow 2.0 using an MNSIT classifier.



Here, you will find the [PowerPoint presentation](https://github.com/mgoutay/tf2_tutorial/blob/master/Training_school_TF2.0_V3.pptx), the [associated PDF](https://github.com/mgoutay/tf2_tutorial/blob/master/Training_school_TF2.0_V3.pdf), and the the [notebook version](https://github.com/mgoutay/tf2_tutorial/blob/master/MNIST_tutorial.ipynb) of the tutorial. It is also available for you [to try on Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mgoutay/tf2_tutorial/blob/master/MNIST_tutorial.ipynb).


The following are discussed :

1. Introduction to Deep Learning
   - What is Deep Learning?
   - Neurons, layers...
   - The training loop : loss function, regularization, SGD.
2. Tensorflow for beginners
   - What's a Tensor, a TF constant & variable
   - Preparing a dataset
   - Building a model with the Sequential API and training it

3. Tensorflow for experts
   - Creating a Tensorflow dataset
   - Defining new layers with the Subclassing API
   - Composing a model from custom layers
4. Building a custom training loop
   - Defining custom training and testing function, and a custom training loop
   - Building a graph with *@tf.function*
   - Adding regularization
   - Building a custom loss function
